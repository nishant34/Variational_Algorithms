# Machine Learning of noise resilient quantum circuits
* Implementation of Nacl model given in the following [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09337.pdf).
* The paper  proposes an idea of selecting architecture using iteration over a pool of gates along with varying the depth value of circuit and making the operations as parallel as possible.

# Requirements
If running on a terminal Anaconda can be used to manage environments.

```javascript
conda create -n myenv
source activate myenv
```
The following packages will be useful for running the code:
* tensorflow 
* tensorflow-quantum
* numpy
* cirq
* sympy
* scipy

To install tensorflow quantum:
```javascript
 pip install -q tensorflow==2.3.1
 pip install -q tensorflow-quantum
 
```
