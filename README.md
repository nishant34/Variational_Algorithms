# Variational_Algorithms
Implementation of Various Quantum Variational Algorithms in tensorflow quantum.
* Variational Grover Algorithm
* Machine learning of noise-resilient quantum circuits
* Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search(Code is merged with 2nd)
* QAOA for Non-planar graphs on a Planar superconducting processor
* Warm Start Quantum Optimisation

An implementation of gradients such as natural, hessians will be uploaded soon.

The simulation notebooks are as follows:
* [Variational Grover](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/147d33KXnn91suRO225ATzrFZxufW2t7A#scrollTo=NZ2C2d_3QZsq)
* [Non planar graphs](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/147d33KXnn91suRO225ATzrFZxufW2t7A#scrollTo=NZ2C2d_3QZsq)(contains most of the plots)
* [Warm Start](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/147d33KXnn91suRO225ATzrFZxufW2t7A#scrollTo=NZ2C2d_3QZsq)

The last 2 papers TQA and the RL based QAOA will be updated soon will be updated by sunday.
