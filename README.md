# Variational_Algorithms
Implementation of Various Quantum Variational Algorithms in tensorflow quantum.
* Variational Grover Algorithm
* Machine learning of noise-resilient quantum circuits
* Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search(Code is merged with 2nd)
* QAOA for Non-planar graphs on a Planar superconducting processor
* Warm Start Quantum Optimisation

An implementation of gradients such as natural, hessians will be uploaded soon.
