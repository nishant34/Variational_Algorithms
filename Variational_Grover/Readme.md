# Variationally learning Grover Search Algorithm
* Implementation of Variationally learning Grover Search Algorithm given in the following [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09337.pdf).
* Basic Gates (only the ones supported by tensorflow quantum) have been used.
* A recursive implementation of N-bit contolled rotation and CNOT gates is provided.

# Requirements
If running on a terminal Anaconda can be used to manage environments.

```javascript
conda create -n myenv
source activate myenv
```
The following packages will be useful for running the code:
* tensorflow 
* tensorflow-quantum
* numpy
* cirq
* sympy
* scipy

To install tensorflow quantum:
```javascript
 pip install -q tensorflow==2.3.1
 pip install -q tensorflow-quantum
 
```
